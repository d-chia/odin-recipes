    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Bow tie pasta tossed with spinach, tomatoes, goat cheese and olive oil. This is the best pasta recipe in the world! I made it up one day instead of serving a heavy pasta dish. The goat cheese makes this recipe!
    </p>
    <p>
        My family including our dog love this dish! I do add fresh sliced garlic to the olive oil and then grill chicken breast to go on top of it. The first night I had made it I had cleaned up dinner and then got a phone call that my daughter had broken her ankle and needed to go to the ER. We rushed out and when when we got back I stepped on something squishy,it was a piece of pasta on the floor. In our rush out of the house, I had left the leftovers on the counter and my dog had decided that was her dinner. She ate all of it with the exception of a tomato or 2. Now whenever I make it she comes into the kitchen and wags her tail and expects to eat with us.
