    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        This is an amazing and unusual salad that is fun for kids to help make. The method sounds strange, but once you try it, you'll want a massaged salad all the time! The salad will look a bit wilted, but it will taste delicious!
    </p>
    <p>
        This is an excellent recipe and my favorite salad! We make it with spinach and I do think the rubbing makes the salad even better. We make this salad several times a week. Sometimes I substitute sun-dried tomatoes if I'm out of fresh tomatoes. Definitely give this one a try!
    </p>

    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>1 (10 ounce) bag mixed baby salad greens</li>
        <li>1 English cucumber, diced</li>

        <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons aged balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
