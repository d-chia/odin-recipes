    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        This sandwich is called a 'Media Noche' which translates to 'Midnight.' It makes a wonderful dinner sandwich because it is served hot. A nice side dish is black bean soup or black beans and rice, and plantain chips.

        GREAT sandwich! Complimented our soup wonderfully! I used a little less mustard but I mixed it into the mayo/italian dressing mix. By the way - the mayo mix made enough for 8 sandwiches with plenty to spare. Knowing this, I may cut that part in half next time. Also - doing the sandwiches on the stove was a pain. I just put them in the oven (open-faced) for approx 5-10 minutes and worked out better this way (and more could be done at one time). Still, a wonderful sandwich - authentic or not - that we will be making plenty of times! Thanks!
